Known as the 'Menkick House', Haertling’s award-winning Usonian design has been made available for the first time in 30 years, and comes with a list price of $6.5 million.\n\nCompleted in 1970, Haertling built the Menkick House around a natural rock outcropping found on the property’s 1.1 acre lot in West Boulder, shaping it in a manner in which the tiers of the four-story home align with the three most prominent stone masses. The resulting ebb and flow of the design not only showcases the 'Gyp Rock', but also creates a contrast in ambiance between the two wings of the 5,780-square-foot home, all the while showcasing stunning views of the Flatirons, Red Rock and Mount Sanitas.\n\nThree of the home’s four bedrooms, along with the kitchen, family room, media room and an art studio, are found in the northern wing. Adjacent to the kitchen and dining area is an impressive cantilever balcony and patio that overlooks the creek. The master suite connects with the rock face through a pierced, split-roof balcony, and comes complete with a bathroom lined with glass windows that give way to the surrounding landscapes.\n\nsource: http://www.realtor.com/news/charles-a-haertling-menkick-house-boulder-colorado-photos/"},
